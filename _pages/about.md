Welcome to my page!

I am an early-career academic who has experienced education in different countries and am currently working as an assistang professor at a university in China. My aspiration is to connect with students who have academic ambitions and, hopefully, to find my best coauthors among them.

My current research focuses on the applications of AI in various industries (AI-human interactions), primarily in healthcare, as well as on relationship management and digital transformation in supply chains (empirical methods). I am also interested in exploring the role of TikTok unions.

Feel free to reach out if you share similar interests or if you are simply curious about my work ðŸ«¶
